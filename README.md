# AstuteVision: Currency Identification and Counterfeit Detection Device for the Visually Impaired

## Overview

This project is an advanced handheld device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in accurately identifying the denominations of Indian banknotes while also incorporating counterfeit detection. The device aims to enhance financial inclusivity and security by leveraging cutting-edge technology.

## Key Features and Functionalities

### 1. Genuineness Verification

- **UV Light Detection**: Detects security threads in banknotes using ultraviolet light.
- **IR Sensor Verification**: Uses infrared sensors to detect watermarks on the banknotes.
- **Microtext Recognition**: Employs advanced image processing to identify very small text printed on the notes, which is a common security feature.

### 2. Denomination Identification

- **Advanced Image Processing**: Uses high-resolution image capturing and sophisticated algorithms to determine the denomination of the banknote.

### 3. Companion App Integration

- **Connectivity via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi**: Pairs with a dedicated companion app that enhances functionality by capturing sensor data, processing the denomination identification, and transmitting the results back to the device.
- **Real-time Processing**: The app processes data in real-time, ensuring swift and reliable results.

### 4. Feedback Mechanism

- **Dynamic Braille Display**: Shows the denomination of the banknote using tactile Braille, allowing visually impaired users to read the denomination with their fingers.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides short vibrations for genuine notes and long vibrations for potential counterfeits, ensuring users can quickly determine the authenticity and denomination of a banknote.

### 5. Additional Functionalities

- **Voice Assistance**: Announces the denomination of the banknote and whether it is genuine or counterfeit.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports multiple languages for voice assistance and app interface, catering to a diverse user base across India.

- **Compact and Portable**: Fits comfortably in one hand, making it easy to carry and use on the go.
- **Tactile Buttons**: Features distinct, raised buttons for easy operation by touch.

### 2. Sensor Integration

- **High-resolution Camera**: Captures detailed images of the banknotes for accurate denomination identification.
- **UV and IR Sensors**: Strategically placed to effectively scan the banknotes for security features.

### 3. Display and Feedback

- **Dynamic Braille Display**: Uses a grid of small, electronically controlled pins that form Braille characters.
- **Vibration Motor**: Provides haptic feedback for quick and clear information on the banknoteâ€™s authenticity.

### 4. Connectivity and Power

- **Wi-Fi Module**: Enables seamless connectivity with the companion app for real-time data processing and updates.
- **Rechargeable Battery**: Provides extended usage on a single charge and is easily rechargeable using a standard USB-C port.
